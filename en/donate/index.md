**Human’ESDES** is a registered non-profit in Lyon, France. We work with  [Jokkolabs](http://jokkolabs.net) in [Mali](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali), a social-change hub and co-working space on the MALeBOOKS project.

## Mali (West Africa) desperately needs books.

That's a fact, and that's a problem. Shipping books is not possible: too heavy, too hard to select, too difficult to distribute and maintain.

**What if we could send them eReaders (Kindle-like) instead** and fill those with thousands of books ? **Would that help ?**

**→ Help us raise about $5,000** and find out after 6 months!

## A Simple Goal ##

We believe in reading being an extremely useful development factor ; by itself.

* We **don't** want to **force people to read**.
* We **don't** want to have them **read only educational content**.
* We want them to **discover and (really) enjoy reading**.
* We want to them to **open their minds** themselves and gain have a free-hobby.

<p style="text-align:center; color:green; font-weight:bold;">We want to provide content-full devices to various groups of people who might benefit from reading and see what happens.</p>

* **Do they use it ?**
* If no, why ? Can the limitation be overcame ?
* If yes, what are they reading ?
* What reading materials are the most attracting ?

## We only need hardware money. Everything else is covered!

We understand how frustrating it can feel to donate to such a project and see all the money going into misc expenditures.

This is why **we already raised $8,000** which will cover all the non-hardware cost: plane tickets, shipping, customs, training, distribution, etc. Indiegogers are only left with the actual hardware, how relieving!

### What we're gonna do

* Get eReaders, solar chargers, microSD cards (that's what you are funding!)
* Put together a complete digital library :
 * Public domain books (2,500+)
 * Amateur-writer texts
 * Texts from published writers who accept to offer their books to our beneficiaries.
 * Free texts from the Internet (short stories mostly)
* Add the complete Wikipedia to the device using [Kiwix](http://kiwix.org). **this is a first !**
* Work with our field partners on the distribution and M&E strategy.
* Ship everything to Bamako.
* In early September:
 * hold a workshop+training in Bamako with field partners to finalize the M&E strategy.
 * Start the distribution mission in [Bamako](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamako) (University Students), [Ségou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segou) (High School) and [Timbuktu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu) (Community).
* After 6 months, we'll publish a detailed report on how the devices are used, what is being read, what the users think of the devices and the content.
