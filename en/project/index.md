# <a name="intro"></a>eReaders for Mali ?

In Mali, despite war and instability, everyone agrees on a deep weakness that prevents development from happening: __ineffectiveness of the educational system__.

On a surface twice as large as France with only one fourth of its population, the Education System, abandonned 20 years ago barely produces results. Corruption, ridiculous wages, rural exodus, teacher’s lack of skills (trained within the same system), disengaging parents, etc. Reasons to fail abound. To the point that even neighboring countries, yet not richer than Mali, hardly recognize it's High School Diploma.

__School don't have libraries__. Public libraries, tied to the Univsersity are very rare and poor. There is actually only two universities in the whole country and the second one hasn't yet produced graduates.

Learning about this situation, we asked Jokkolabs, a social-entrepreneurship think-tank with roots in Senegal, Mali, France and Burkina Faso to __find concrete solutions__, directly beneficiable to students with limited access to Education and Culture.

A brainstorming with blogger organisations, members of the Ministry of Education, entrepreneurs and other NGOs __lead to a solution: read… with an eReader__.

# <a name="why"></a>Why eReaders?

Most Master's graduate in Mali never owned a single book. At best, they tied together copies from their university teacher.

Reading a novel is a luxury that brings surprising opportunities to the rare who has access to it : better writting skills, better vocabulary, mind-opening, better general knowledge, better thinking, self-evaluation, increased job opportunities, etc.

__Reading is a personnal development booster__.

__Why an eReader so ?__ Why not improving the situation in a classic way: with books ?

eReaders has several interesting advantages:

* It's lightweight (about 0.45lb). It thus is a lot easier to carry (both in terms of logistics and cost) than a few books.
* It has a huge storage capacity: between 2,000 and 4,000 books.
* It is robust. In a environment where everything is lent and re-lent, an eReader would have a way longer life span than a book.
* While it requires power, it's consumption is minimal. The eReader has a month-long autonomy, which is enormous.

# <a name="project"></a>Project

Our Project consist in providing eReaders to young malians, so that they can instantly and directly benefit from them.

It is a _field project_ though. It inclues an on-site user training which will allow us to make sure the equipments arrive and are distributed as expected.

Also, this Project is a pilot which we hope will provide enough information on the necessity and the impact of eReaders. This is a real-life test of a model that might be scaled-up.

The Project is broke down in four stages:

1. Procurement of the eReaders.
1. Preparation of a library of contents and Setup of the readers.
1. Shipment to Bamako.
1. Local partners training.
 1. Identification of beneficiaries.
 1. Usage Strategy Design.
 1. Monitory & Evaluation canvas design.

As described, __this is not a logistic project__ but a conplete educational mission from its design to the distribution, the training, it's usage and the reporting.

Elaborating the __content list is a crucial step__, Jokkolabs tells us: <blockquote>“Many projects failed in time because they were focalizing on hardware issues: computers, Internet, etc. What makes a difference is __the content__. It must be __large__, but it must also be __varied__: french classics, comptenporary Sci-Fi, african writers, etc.”</blockquote>

This is why we envision __three types of content__:

* All the free or public domain books in french.
* All of Wikipedia.
* A Selection of novels and short stories from amateur (unpublished) writers who would be willing to include their work on the readers.

Distribution is also very important as we need to pick locations with the __highest possible impact__. We are working ont this topic with our partners in Mali. However, in order to properly collect an analyze the results, we plan on sending __only a few dozens of readers__ in selected places.

__Technicaly__, trainers will be trained in Bamako on using the device but also on its maintenance and content management. They will also be trained on how to create new content for the reader from their original documents (Ministry of Education wants to try some curriculum this way). Then, these people will train the direct users of the readers, in their own rural locations and will be the one handing the devices to them, as well as a mini solar charger.

# <a name="partners"></a>Partners

# <a name="needs"></a>Needs

While being just a pilot, the project has ambitious standards in that it aims at providing a scale-up strategy.

However, thanks to the numerous partners involved, our __financial needs are limited to Hardware procurements only__.

# <a name="distribution"></a>Choosing beneficiaries

<img class="onelogo" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Mali_Regions.png/280px-Mali_Regions.png" />

eReaders will be spread over three groups:

1. __10 readers__ will be distributed in the [Ségou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segou) Region, all within one High School with a dedicated teacher and a pool of interested students.
1. __10 readers__ will be distributed in the [Timbuktu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu) Region, directly to young people within one community. Essay contests will help us identify beneficiaries and involvment of local radio stations will ensure the community supports them.
1. __10 readers__ will be distributed to students in [Bamako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamako).

__In Bamako, 10 University students__ from various levels and faculties will be selectioned and trained directly. We will use the numerous clubs and organisations (like the [Francophone Digital Campus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_num%C3%A9rique_francophone)) to find the most promising and needing ones. __We expect them  to share the reader with their relatives__.

Those **three different approaches** will help us understand what makes the most sense in this context.

* Is it revelant to work with Schools ?
* Does the community-involvement help in using the devices ?
* What age-group are the devices most benefical to ?

**We won't provide any reading programme**. Readers will be filled with easy-to-access content and beneficiaries trained on using them. **We just want them to come to loving reading**.

### Trainers' training

A training will take place at Jokkolabs with:

* Human'ESDES and Jokkolabs Teams.
* Delegates from the CBM.
* Ten selected students from Bamako.

Training Programme:

* Actual usage and maintenance of the device.
* Usage and maintenance of the solar charger.
* Browsing the (very large) library of content.
* Reader Features.
* Using Wikipedia on the device.
* Updating the device's content ; modifying the library.
* Creating content for the reader (file format convertion).
* Reader Usage & sharing policy.
* Monitoring & Evaluation Indicators to collect and tools (discussion, enhancements).
* Equipments and monitoring tools hand-over.

This training will also allow participants to discuss about how the project will be run, its objectives and possible evolutions. Participants will be the ones responsible for the evaluation of the project and they are the ones collecting indicators.

{% include break.html %}

### Field training

CBM delegates will both execute a __training and distribution mission__ in their respective regions: Ségou and Timbuktu.

They will __iteratively go to each designated school__ and will re-run the training they attended themselves. Participants will be the School head and the teachers.

It is important to note that __all schools will be geographicaly close to each others__ in order to __create a synergy__ and better __observe the impact__ on people.

# <a name="evaluation"></a>Project Evaluation

Evaluation takes place at three different levels:

* Financial Evaluation: Report on actual costs and an extrapolation on them for scale-up.
* Information and indicators collection about the usage of the readers ; from the teachers and students.
* Monitoring of the beneficiaries by CBM and analysis of indicators in order to produce statistics and a usage/cost ratio report.

### Usage Monitoring

It is very important for the project to __know if the readers are being used and how__. In short, is it revelent to provide readers to those people ?

To do so, teachers will be given forms:

* who use them?
* when?
* what usage is made of the library?
* how easy is it to access eBooks?
* which eBooks are abandonned?
* which ones are read?
* et caetera.

Those documents will be published online once received.

CBM delegates will be responsible for __keeping a regular contact__ with the users-evaluators in order to __prevent any avoidable problem to disrupt the project__. However, if the readers are not used by a __lack of interest__, this is an indicator to us.

### Results Compilation

After an __initial 6 months period__, potentially followed by adjustments and a __second identical period__, we will collect and prepare all the data in order to produce every possible indicators. We will __share them online__, including raw data.

These data will be used in our __detailed report on usage, relevance, impact and economical value of distributing eReaders__.
